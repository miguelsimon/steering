A few [steering behaviours](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/) implemented in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly.

Source for building this site can be found at [https://github.com/miguelsimon/steering](https://github.com/miguelsimon/steering).

This is mainly an exercise to teach myself cmake and C++.
